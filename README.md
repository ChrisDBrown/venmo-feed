# Venmo Live Payments

Quickly thrown together to show what Venmo allows access to if you don't lock down the privacy settings on your account. This isn't everything - photos & comments are available, but this is the most critical info. The only thing really missing is exact payment value.

Note that this no longer works - Venmo has disabled their public API, and is returning a list of fake examples rather than live data. This is a good thing. It was clear most people didn't realise that this information was public. A few articles worth reading for better analysis than I can put together:
- The Guardian: [
